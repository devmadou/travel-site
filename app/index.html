        For the navigation <nav> element, we could have used BEM and

        But in BEM, it's ok to nest one block inside another block
        Moreover, we may be looking at a design pattern when it comes to
        putting 'ul' elements in a single line, so it would be more appropriate
        not to give it a class that couples the 'nav' to the block 'site-header'
        so we can reuse the class later
        We will then consider that block its own block called 'primary-nav'-->

  <!-- Just for info, we use a normal image (and not a background image),
  because it is easier to deal with responsivness with an <img /> tag -->

  <!-- A responsive image is not only about the size, but also about the cropping -->
  <!-- We use a <picture> so we can send different cropped image files
    to different screen size
    To sum up, we have 3 aspects to take into account
    when dealing with responsive images:
    - size of the image
    - resolution of the image
    - cropping of the image

    The 'srcset' attribute allows the user to download the appropriate image
    depending on the device physical properties
    A device is self aware and knows the size of their own screen
    and the pixel density of their own screen

    Indeed, browser and device are intelligent enough to know
    how to pick the right image but we need to gide them since they both cannot know
    the size of an image until they downloaded it
    We can therefore tell the browser in advance the size of each image so it knows
    which one to use

    We thus guide them by specifying the width of the image ('640w' for example)

    Don't be surprised if when shrinking the page, the right image size is not applied
    This is because the browser choose to keep the high resolution image since
    it has already downloaded it instead of downloading an additional
    lower resolution image it uses the higher resolution image since
    it has been cached already so is available

            "listen, this image particular source is never going
            to be displayed larger than 404 pixels" through our CSS
            (For info, as before, if you don't see any changes,
            don't get fooled by the already cached image,
            moreover, I guess before we did not have that problem because we were only creating
            images whose width was 100% of the screen size, but here, we only want
            the image to be one third of the 12 columns) -->

          add the class 10 times)
          Therefore, in that particular case, we will forget about the BEM methodology

  lazy loading even to our images defined as background-image in the CSS file
  Indeed, here the testimonials section has a background image applied with the
  class 'page-section--testimonials' and we added the 'lazyload' just behind
  
  Actually, what happens behind the scene is that 'lazysizes' at the exact moment
  where the background image is about to appear will swicth the 'lazyload' classname
  into 'lazyloadED' so into our CSS rule, we can configure the browser so
  that the background image is applied when the switch in name from 'lazyload'

      Using Flexbox in non supporting browser can break the design
      Especially here, no flexbox present results in our 3 columns
      being merged to a single one when using it
      To avoid that, we will use Modernizr that will skip the defined
      'row--equal-height-at-large' rule that is now available only for HTML
      that have the 'flexbox' class of Modernizr added
