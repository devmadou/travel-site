  <!-- Just for info, we use a normal image (and not a background image),
  because it is easier to deal with responsivness with an <img /> tag -->

  <!-- A responsive image is not only about the size, but also about the cropping -->
  <!-- We use a <picture> so we can send different cropped image files
    to different screen size
    To sum up, we have 3 aspects to take into account
    when dealing with responsive images:
    - size of the image
    - resolution of the image
    - cropping of the image

    The 'srcset' attribute allows the user to download the appropriate image
    depending on the device physical properties
    A device is self aware and knows the size of their own screen
    and the pixel density of their own screen

    Indeed, browser and device are intelligent enough to know
    how to pick the right image but we need to gide them since they both cannot know
    the size of an image until they downloaded it
    We can therefore tell the browser in advance the size of each image so it knows
    which one to use

    We thus guide them by specifying the width of the image ('640w' for example)

    Don't be surprised if when shrinking the page, the right image size is not applied
    This is because the browser choose to keep the high resolution image since
    it has already downloaded it instead of downloading an additional
    lower resolution image it uses the higher resolution image since
    it has been cached already so is available

        in a 12 grid system column: so we get 'row__4' for example
        We added 'medium' here so this organization in column is applied
        only on desktop screens (via a media query) but on mobiles,
        there will be only a single element by row
        -->

            <!-- Sometimes, the browser reaches for the largest copy of the image,
            when the image is responsive,
            it is because the browser assumes the image should take the entire screen width,
            this is why we added the 'sizes' attribute so we can guide the browser and
            tell it what size the image will be rendered at
            Basically, it's as if we were telling chrome:
            "listen, this image particular source is never going
            to be displayed larger than 404 pixels" through our CSS
            (For info, as before, if you don't see any changes,
            don't get fooled by the already cached image,
            moreover, I guess before we did not have that problem because we were only creating
            images whose width was 100% of the screen size, but here, we only want
            the image to be one third of the 12 columns) -->

          if we follow the BEM way, we would create a class and apply it for  each of our
          3 paragraphs which is repetitive (what if we would have 10 paragrahs? would we
          add the class 10 times)
          Therefore, in that particular case, we will forget about the BEM methodology
          and wrap the title and the paragrahs within in a new <div> with a class of
          'generic-content-container'
          Why not add that class to the already existing 'row__medium-8 row__medium-8--smaller' div?
          in case we want the rule to be applied only to these paragrahs and not the whole
