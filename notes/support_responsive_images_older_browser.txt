The picture element and the srcset attribute is not supported by all older browsers
More precisely, we have:
- 'picture' element: supported by 71% of browser traffic
- 'srcset' element: supported by 73% of browser traffic

In order to avoid leaving almost one third of people who could browse our site,
we will install a JavaScript package named Picturefill that will perform its magic
and make these 'picture' and 'src' element working without any problems
on older browsers

After Picturefill's passage, the numbers will be 100% of support
We will add Picturefill to the 'Vendor.js' file by importing it
That is actually all what we need to do, just import Picturefill
