The idea behind lazy loading is to only download assets when they become necessary

For example, imagine if a user opens our page and does not even scroll
to the bottom of it, while at the same time we are downloading
the entire contentof the whole page at one time
maybe we could select the order in which the browser,
this would result in a waste of his data plan!!

We can therefore use lazy loading so we can delay elements downloads
to a more appropriate time depending on the user's behavior.

In this lesson, we will focus on lazy loading our images.
More precisely, we only want to download images
as they are getting ready to be scrolled into view
